I feel like I tried to learn Farsi, Greek, and Sanskrit this week. So many different ways to do the same thing. And as of this writing, I still haven't had a chance to really dig into Emacs. I've reached the interface but still am trying to undo the automatic response of using keyboard shortcuts that I use in a Windows or MS Office environment. 

I'm using Nano for this file only because it was easy for me to quickly hammer out a note about this assignment. There are definite advantages to all of them. Vim is *very* dynamic and I can see myself really want to explore it further. They weren't kidding when they said it was a steep learning curve. Personally it feels more like a learning wall than curve. But sometimes if you bang your head against the wall long enough, you can make a small dent. But instead of risking head injury and the need for copious amounts of ibuprofen, I used Google for commands. 

This stuff is fascinating and I'm really looking forward to using it in my new career.
